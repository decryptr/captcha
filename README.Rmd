This package is an extensible API to build models and solve CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). It provides tools to read, visualize, classify, model and share fitted models. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{captcha}` package running

``` r
remotes::install_github("decryptr/captcha")
```

## Basic usage

The basic usage of `{captcha}` involves the functions `read_captcha()`, `plot()`, `classify()`, `captcha_load_model()` and `decrypt()`. The diagram below summarizes the relationships between these functions. The arrows indicate the dependency of functions on objects generated by other functions.

```{r}
#| label: fig-captcha-diagram-simple
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/diagram.png")
```

### Read and visualize

The `read_captcha()` function reads an array of image files and stores them in memory. Behind the scenes, the function uses the `{magick}` package to deal with the types of files that may appear (JPEG, PNG, among others).

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-plot-inicial
#| echo: true
#| out-width: 30%
library(captcha)
exemplo <- "man/figures/dados_tjmg.jpeg"
captcha <- read_captcha(exemplo)

captcha
```

The function returns an object with the `captcha` class, which can be used by other methods.

```{r}
#| echo: true
class(captcha)
```

The object is a list with three elements: `$img`, which contains the image read from the `{magick}` package, `$lab`, which contains the image label (by default, `NULL`), and `$path `, which contains the path of the image that was read.

```{r}
#| echo: true
str(captcha)
```

The `read_captcha()` function has an `ans_in_path=` parameter, which indicates whether the label is contained in the image path. If `ans_in_path=TRUE`, the function will try to extract the label from the file (getting the text that comes after the last `_` of the path) and store it in the `$lab` element.

```{r}
#| echo: true
exemplo <- "man/figures/mnist128c49c36e13_6297.png"
captcha <- read_captcha(exemplo, ans_in_path = TRUE)

str(captcha)
```

The plot function `plot()` is a method of [class S3](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html) from basic R. The function was implemented to facilitate the visualization of Captchas. The function receives a list of images obtained by the `read_captcha()` function and displays the Captcha visually, as in the image below.

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-plot
#| echo: true
#| out-width: 30%
exemplo <- "man/figures/dados_tjmg.jpeg"
captcha <- read_captcha(exemplo)
plot(captcha)
```

An interesting aspect of the `plot()` function is that it deals with a list of Captchas. This is useful when you are interested in viewing several Captchas in the image at once. The next image shows an example.

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-plot-multi
#| echo: true
#| out-width: 70%
exemplos <- paste0("man/figures/", c(
  "dados_tjmg.jpeg",
  "dados_esaj.png",
  "dados_rfb.png",
  "dados_sei.png"
))
captchas <- read_captcha(exemplos)
plot(captchas)
```

By default, the plot function arranges the images in four columns. To change the default, you can modify the options using `options(captcha.print.cols = N)`, where `N` is the desired number of columns. The next image shows an example with two columns.

```{r}
#| echo: false
# backup option (hidden)
op <- getOption("captcha.print.cols")
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-example-plot-multi-2col
#| out-width: 60%
options(captcha.print.cols = 2)
plot(captchas)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# back to original option (hidden)
options(captcha.print.cols = op)
```

When the array of Captchas is too large, the `plot()` function displays a maximum number of images, accompanied by a message. By default, this number is 100, with 25 rows and 4 columns. The option can be overridden by combining the `captcha.print.cols=` and `captcha.print.rows=` options. The next image shows an example of the function's behavior when the number of images exceeds 100.

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-plot-multi-many
#| message: true
#| echo: true

# more than 100 imagens:
examples <- rep("man/figures/dados_tjmg.jpeg", 110)
captchas <- read_captcha(examples)
plot(captchas)
```

An interesting detail is that it is possible to create subsets of a `captcha` class object simply using the `[` operator. The `length()` function can also be used to measure the amount of images read. The next image shows an example of these operations.

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-plot-multi-many-subset
#| echo: true
captchas_subset <- captchas[1:20]
length(captchas_subset) # 20
plot(captchas_subset)
```

Finally, if the image has a label, by default the `plot()` function shows the label in the corner of the image. The next image shows an example.

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-plot-rotulado
#| echo: true
#| out-width: 30%
example <- "man/figures/mnist128c49c36e13_6297.png"
captcha <- read_captcha(example, ans_in_path = TRUE)
plot(captcha)
```

### Classify

The `classify()` function serves to classify a Captcha image, either manually or automatically. This is done by modifying the image path, adding the text `_label` to the end of the file path. The function has the parameters listed below:

- `files=`: object of class `captcha` read with function `read_captcha()` (recommended) or array of file paths.
- `answers=`: (optional) vector with image labels. Must be the same `length()` as `files=`. By default, the value is `NULL`, indicating that a `prompt` should be opened for the user to enter the answer manually.
- `path=`: (optional) path of the folder where classified files will be saved. By default, it saves files with modified names in the same folder as the original files.
- `rm_old=`: (optional) whether or not to delete the original files. By default it is `FALSE`.

The function returns a vector with the paths of the modified files. The `answer` parameter is useful for handling situations where we know the Captcha label. For example, in a workflow that uses oracle, it might be that an initial template already provides the correct label value.

When the initial model fails or when no initial model exists, it is the user's role to enter the label manually. This is facilitated with the `classify()` function, which opens the `prompt` for classification and applies `plot()` to visualize the image. The next image shows an application example of the `classify()` function in the software [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-classify
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/exemplo_classify.png")
```

### Predict

The function `decrypt()` has the role of obtaining the label of an image using a model already trained for that type of image. The function takes two arguments: `file=` which can be either the file path or a `captcha` class object, and a `model=` argument, which contains a `luz_module_fitted` class model, fitted using the tools that will be presented in the next subsection.

```{r}
#| label: fig-example-decrypt
#| out-width: 30%
#| message: false
model <- captcha_load_model("cadesp")
img <- "man/figures/dados_cadesp.jpg"
captcha <- read_captcha(img)
plot(captcha)
decrypt(captcha, model)
```

Models were developed for several different Captchas. It is possible to load an already trained model using the `captcha_load_model()` function, being able to receive in its only parameter `path=` the path of a file containing an adjusted model or a *string* with the name of an already trained model, like `"rfb"`, for example. Trained models are stored in the [captcha package repository releases](https://github.com/decryptr/captcha/releases), are downloaded and controlled by the [`{piggyback}` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/piggyback/), and are read using the [`{luz}` package](https://mlverse.github.io/luz/), which will be described in more detail in the next subsection. 

For now, the Captchas with developed models were `trf5`, `tjmg`, `trt`, `esaj`, `jucesp`, `tjpe`, `tjrs`, `cadesp`, `sei` and ` rfb`. The table below shows all the available models and their accuracy.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-available-models
#| message: false
#| echo: false

acc <- purrr::map_dbl(
  available_models(),
  \(x) {
    model <- captcha_load_model(x)
    dplyr::last(model$records$metrics$valid)[["captcha acc"]]
  }
) |> 
  purrr::set_names(available_models()) |> 
  tibble::enframe()

doutorado::da_captchas |> 
  
  dplyr::mutate(
    exemplo = stringr::str_replace(exemplo, "assets/img", "man/figures"),
    name = stringr::str_extract(site, "(?<=\\[)[0-9a-z]+")
  ) |> 
  dplyr::inner_join(acc, "name") |> 
  dplyr::transmute(
    site, 
    exemplo, 
    descricao, 
    acc = formattable::percent(value, 2)
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Name/Link", "Example", "Description", "Accuracy")
  )

```

### Fit custom model

The `{captcha}` package provides a basic interface for developing models from a fully labeled data. Classification can be done manually by the `classify()` function, presented earlier, or by another method developed by the user.

The modeling part starts from some assumptions about the database. Images must be in a folder and have the pattern `path/to/file/<id>_<lab>.<ext>`, where:

- `<id>`: can be any name, preferably without accents or other special characters, to avoid *encoding* problems. This is usually a *hash* identifying the type and id of the captcha. **Note**: When classifying a case it is important that the `id` is unique as two Captchas can have the same label.
- `<lab>`: is the Captcha label. Can be a string of characters between `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, case sensitive if necessary. Currently, all files in a folder must be the same number of characters (homogeneous length). In the future, the package may consider Captchas of heterogeneous length.
- `<ext>`: file extension. It can be `.png`, `.jpeg` or `.jpg`. The operations also work for the `.svg` format, but it may have problems due to the transparency of the image.

The `captcha_fit_model()` function fits a model from a folder with classified files. The function receives the parameters: `dir=`, containing the path of the classified files; `dir_valid=`, (optional) containing the path of classified files for validation; `prop_valid=`, containing the proportion of the training base to be considered as validation, ignored when `dir_valid=` is given (by default, 20% of the base is considered as validation)

The `captcha_fit_model()` function also has some parameters related to modeling. They are: `dropout=`, specifying the *dropout* percentage applied to the hidden layers of the network (by default, `0.25`); `dense_units=`, specifying the amount of units in the hidden layer that comes after the convolutional layers (by default, 200); `decay=`, specifying the learning rate decay percentage (by default, `0.99`); `epochs=` number of epochs to fit the model (by default 100). An important observation is that the model is configured to stop fitting after 20 iterations without significant reduction in the loss function (arbited at 1%; for more details see the [advanced guide](TODO)).

At the end, the function returns a fitted model with the `luz_module_fitted` class, which can be saved to disk using the `luz_save()` function. The model can also be serialized for use in other packages such as pytorch. A tutorial on serialization can be found in the [torch package documentation](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/articles/serialization.html).

In the `{captcha}` package documentation, an application example has been added. The example uses captchas generated using the `captcha_generate()` function, which generates Captchas using the `{magick}` package. The Captcha was created for the construction of the thesis, nicknamed `R-Captcha`, and has the following parameters:

- `write_disk=`: save files to disk? By default it is false.
- `path=`: Path to save files on disk, if the previous parameter is true.
- `chars=`: Which characters to use in the image.
- `n_chars=`: The length of the Captcha.
- `n_rows=`: Height of the image, in pixels.
- `n_cols=`: Width of the image, in pixels.
- `p_rotate=`: Probability of image rotation.
- `p_line=`: Probability of adding a line between the letters.
- `p_stroke=`: Probability of adding a border to the letters.
- `p_box=`: Probability of adding a box (rectangle) around the letters.
- `p_implode=`: Probability of adding implode effects.
- `p_oilpaint=`: Probability to add oil paint effects.
- `p_noise=`: Probability of adding white noise to the background of the image.
- `p_lat=`: Probability of applying the *local adaptive thresholding* algorithm to the image.

## Advanced usage

Once the premises of the classified base are met, it is possible to adjust a neural network model using the `{captcha}` package. However, as the adjustment of neural network models involves a series of nuances and small adaptations, it was decided to export functions in two depth levels. The first is the **automated**, using the `captcha_fit_model()` function described below, while the second is the **procedural**, using the step-by-step procedure described in the [advanced guide](TODO).
